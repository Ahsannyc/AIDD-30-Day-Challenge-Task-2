The `validate_email` function is designed to check if an email string is correctly formatted by ensuring it contains exactly one "@" symbol separating a non-empty username and a domain. It will also validate that the domain includes a period followed by a valid top-level domain extension, such as ".com" or ".org", which must consist of at least two alphabetic characters. If the email fails validation, the function will not raise an exception but will instead return a clear, user-friendly error message detailing the specific issue, such as "Email is missing the '@' symbol," "Domain must contain a period," or "Invalid domain extension," while returning a success indicator if all checks pass.
