Q1. Nin Pillars understanding  

Using Ai-Dev.agent like gemini cli is better for coder’s (like us) growth because it stops us wasting our time on manual and repetitive code writing and lets us focus on systems design and architectural style thinking, so we are not just coders anymore, but we are creative thinkers. 

Nine-pillars provide us the integrated system of tools and agents that are like a complete team . This will create a link a bridge between all the areas to develop a better producer like M-Shaped developer 

 

Q2. Vide Coding vs Spec-driven development 

Vibe-coding is like building a project what ever we feel right at the moment, like our gut feelings but it becomes difficult to grow the project since we cant properly add up new ideas into it properly, since no planning or thinking was involved, so no project structure, no architecture, it is hard to extend or change 

 

But in spec-driven development, we have a clear direction, like a blue print,  with detailed instructions before we even start a project. So we have a clear requirements and a plan before coding begins. We write down every detail we want. So, we can easily add new features or fix things later.  

 

Q3. Architecture thinking 

Architecture-first thinking shifts the role from a code writer to a creative thinker. We focus on designing than just coding.  

 

Developers must think in layers  

 We must focus on different steps and visualize the project to see which layer or step needs what so we can give better instructions to CLI
